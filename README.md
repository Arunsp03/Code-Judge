# üß† LeetCode-esque Code Execution Platform

A lightweight online coding platform inspired by LeetCode and Codeforces. Users can pick a problem and write solutions in Python or JavaScript, which are then executed securely using the [Judge0 API](https://judge0.com/).

## üöÄ Features

- üìù Choose coding problems to solve
- üíª Code editor with support for **Python** and **JavaScript**
- üß™ Executes user-submitted code via **Judge0 API**
- üõ°Ô∏è Sandboxed execution for secure runtime environments
- ‚öôÔ∏è Asynchronous backend handling for smooth execution flow

## üß† What I Learned

This project was built to understand the core logic behind coding platforms:

- How sandboxed code execution works under the hood
- Managing asynchronous code execution systems
- Understanding how code is created, queued, and executed securely
- Architecting a system like LeetCode from scratch

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: UI and database were intentionally minimal ‚Äî the focus was on backend logic and execution flow.
